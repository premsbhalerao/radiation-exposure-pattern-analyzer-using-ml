☢️ **Radiation Exposure Pattern Analyzer using Machine Learning**

A machine learning-based system to analyze and predict radiation exposure patterns from historical and sensor-based data. This helps in identifying high-risk areas, exposure trends, and safe zones for preventive action.

🧠 **About the Project**

This project aims to assist scientists, researchers, and radiation safety officers in identifying **radiation exposure patterns** using machine learning algorithms. It can be applied in nuclear facilities, medical labs, and industrial environments to detect potential hazards before they escalate.

📌 **Features**

- 📊 Analyze historical radiation exposure data
- 📍 Identify high-risk zones
- 🔍 Visualize radiation trends using graphs
- 🧠 Train ML models to predict exposure
- 🖥️ Interactive UI using Streamlit

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

**Steps**

-Upload radiation data (CSV format)
-Click on "Analyze" to view exposure statistics
-View predictions and visual patterns
-Download analysis report (optional)

🧪 **Model Info**

Algorithm used: Random Forest / Logistic Regression
Input features: Time, Location, Exposure Level, Sensor ID
Output: Exposure Risk Category (Low/Medium/High)
